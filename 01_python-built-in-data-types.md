# Chapter 01: Python Built-in Data Types

Python contains many built-in data types, which include one None type (`None`), four numeric types(`int`, `float`, `complex`, `bool`), four sequence types (`str`, `list`, `tuple`, `range`), one mapping type (`dict`), and two set types (`set`, `fronzenset`).  
The built-in data types are outlined in the following table:

| Category     | Name     | Description     |
|     :---     | ----     | ----            |
|   None   |  `None`    | A null object     |
| Numeric  |  `int`     |   An integer data type   |
|          | `float`    |   A floating-point number   |
|      |      |      |
|      |      |      |
|      |      |      |
|      |      |      |
|      |      |      |
|      |      |      |
|      |      |      |
|      |      |      |
|      |      |      |



We will starts with reviewing the None and Numeric types in this chapter and other

We will starts with string in this chapter and the remaining built-in types in the next chapters.
