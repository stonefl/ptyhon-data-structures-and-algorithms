# Chapter 01: Python Built-in Data Types


Python contains many built-in data types, which include one None type (`None`), four numeric types(`int`, `float`, `complex`, `bool`), four sequence types (`str`, `list`, `tuple`, `range`), one mapping type (`dict`), and two set types (`set`, `fronzenset`). 


The built-in data types are outlined in the following table. 


| Category     | Name     | Description     |
|     :---     | ----     | ----            |
|   None   |  `None`    | a null object     |
| Numeric  |  `int`     |   an integer data type   |
|          | `float`    |   a floating-point number   |
|      |  `complex`    |  stores a complex number    |
|      | `bool`     | a Boolean type and returns `true` or `false` |
| Sequence    |   `str`   | a string of characters     |
|      |   `list`   | a list of arbitrary objects     |
|      | `tuple`     |   a group of arbitrary items   |
|      |   `range`   |   a range of integers   |
| Mapping     |   `dict`   | a dictionary data type for **key/value** objects     |
|   Set   |   `set`   | a mutable and unordered collection of unique items     |
|      |  `frozenset`    | an immutable set     |


We will starts with reviewing the None and Numeric types in this chapter and continue the remaining built-in types in the next chapters.
