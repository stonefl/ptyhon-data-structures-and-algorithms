# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

Implement complex data structures and algorithms with Python

## Introduction
Data structures and algorithms are the most fundamental concepts in computing. This book focuses on implementing complex data structures and algorithms with Python. It starts from Python built-in data types, to more complicated user-defined data structures, and finally to algorithms that leveraging these data structures.
