# Introduction

Python contains many built-in data types. These include four numeric types(`int`, `float`, `complex`, `bool`), four sequence types (`str`, `list`, `tuple`, `range`), one mapping type (`dict`), and two set types. It is also possible to create user-defined objects, such as functions or classes. We will starts with string in this chapter and the remaining built-in types in the next chapters.

# String

In Python, strings are **immutable** sequence objects, with each character representing an element in the sequence. As with all objects, we use methods to perform operations. Strings, being immutable, do not change the instance; each method simply returns a value.

The following table is a list of some of the most commonly used string methods and their descriptions:
