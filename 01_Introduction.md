Python contains many built-in data types. These include four numeric types(`int`, `float`, `complex`, `bool`), four sequence types (`str`, `list`, `tuple`, `range`), one mapping type (`dict`), and two set types (`set`, `fronzenset`). It is also possible to create user-defined objects, such as functions or classes. We will starts with string in this chapter and the remaining built-in types in the next chapters.
